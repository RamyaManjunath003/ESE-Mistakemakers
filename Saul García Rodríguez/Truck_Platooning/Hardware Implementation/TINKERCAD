## Hardware implementation in TinkerCad

Simulation steps:

1.    Vehicle detected without lights (before opening a gap)	
        * Sensor: dist<2
	      - Vehicle detected

2.   Vehicle detected with lights (before opening a gap)
        * Sensor: dist<2, Enter in Serial monitor: 0
        -Opening Gap...
	      -Opened Gap
--Once Opened Gap there are 2 possible options:
  2.1.    Vehicle detected turn off lights after opening a gap
            * Sensor: dist<2, Serial Monitor: 2
	          -Closing Gap...
   	        -Vehicle detected

  2.2.    Vehicle detected dissapears after opening a gap
            * Sensor: dist<2, Serial Monitor: 2
            -Closing Gap...
            -Happy Journey!
